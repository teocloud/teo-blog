We've finally published version 0.0.53 with Node.js support. We will continue
to enhance the developer experience and maintain the packages of different
language bindings.

In the future, we will support Python, Java and Go. But for now, we start to
focus on integration tests and schema language warnings and errors.

We are on the way, to level up developers experiences.
