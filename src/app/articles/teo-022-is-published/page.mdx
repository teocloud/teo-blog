Beginning with this new release, Teo supports Node.js, Python and Rust. The 
rust version is for extreme performance. The Node.js is great at integrating 
with web technologies. The Python version is great with AI infrastructures.

In the future, we will update our frontend clients to support more platforms 
including Apple Vision Pro.
