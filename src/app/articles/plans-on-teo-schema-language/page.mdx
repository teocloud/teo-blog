Teo is implemented with Rust, however, developers have different biases. For
most of the ordinary developers, rust is a hard language to learn. Our goal is
to support different programming languages to reach more potential developers.

Declaring model schema with programming languages has limitations and pitfalls.
Modern model schema is more complicated than what programming language classes
and structs can express.

Tools like GraphQL and Prisma have great schema language. We will introduce
Teo schema language which is inspired by GraphQL and Prisma. The syntax will be
similar but more rigid, and modifier pipeline will be supported.
