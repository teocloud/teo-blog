In 2023, I did a lot of things including:

* VSCode extension
* Builtin linter and diagnostic messages
* Namespace
* Entity generation for Rust and Node.js
* Client generation for TS, Swift, Dart, Kotlin and C#
* More detailed API documentation and guides
* Custom handlers
* Custom middlewares

In 2024, I plan to ship these great features and tools:

* Revamped Node.js server implementation
* Revamped Swift, Dart, Kotlin and C# client
* Add back pre-existing features like authentication and action transformer
* Teo Studio, a desktop app which works like database viewer and HTTP request sender
* A auto generated management system from schemas
* Python server implementation

Anyway, the crucial goal is to gain more users and developers. If you are interested
