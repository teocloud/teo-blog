Admin dashboard is vital for almost all projects that utilize server. We 
implemented admin dashboard generation for our users and developers to build
great admin dashboard experience.

This is a long way to go. And we've deliver a very beginning beta version of it.

## Shimmer loading effects

The shimmer loading effects look great comparing to the old school loading 
indicator.

period of time, and a tooltip will be displayed.

## Multiple languages

We plan to support every language which is in use. Currently, only English and 
Chinese are supported. We hope users from different countries could provide us 
a translation file. We want to support every language.

## Custom form control width

The control width of the forms can be customized with a very elegant context 
menu.

## Form control with null value

We support explicit null values in the form. A nullable field has a special 
null locking button.

## Summary

Despite the user interface may not look that great, we expect our users to 
provide ideas on how to update the design. Anyway, we created a great 
navigation experience. And in the stable version, it will become great.

Try and use it. Give us feedbacks. And we hope Teo admin dashboard could save 
you and your team plenty of cost and time.
